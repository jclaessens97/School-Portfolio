# School-Portfolio
All my school projects I made during my education (that I can may post publicly online)

## List of projects
* **Software Architecture**: Advanced programming cource with the focus on clean code, microservices and Spring framework.
* **Functional Programming**: Language processing software programmed with Scala and JavaFX frontend to learn the principles of strictly Functional Programming.
* **Cyber Security**: As a project for Cyber Security we created our own spyware (including undetected keylogger, screen/microphone/webcam capturing). On virustotal.com only 2 out of 71 anti virusses detected our spyware. In the document "Selfmade Spyware.pdf" you can read everything about this project (but it is only available in dutch).
