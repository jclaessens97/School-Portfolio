# School-Portfolio
All my school projects I made during my education (that I may post publicly online)

## List of projects
* **Software Architecture**: Advanced programming cource with the focus on clean code, microservices and Java Spring framework.
* **Functional Programming**: Language processing software programmed with Scala and JavaFX frontend to learn the principles of strictly Functional Programming.
* **Cyber Security**: As a project for Cyber Security we created our own spyware in C++ (including undetected keylogger, screen/microphone/webcam capturing). On virustotal.com only 2 out of 71 anti virusses detected our spyware. In the document "Selfmade Spyware.pdf" you can read everything about this project (but it is only available in dutch).
* **Integratieproject 1**: Large project where we had to build a full stack project with .NET Core in an MVC project. Also involves some IoT with Arduino and DevOps to Google Cloud.
* **Integratieproject 2**: Full stack multiplayer Cluedo with Java Spring and Angular. Backend consists of a microservice architecture. Both realtime (using websockets) and offline mode are implemented using Test Driven Development. No 100% code coverage for back- and frontend, because our time was limited to just 6 weeks, while having other courses as well.
